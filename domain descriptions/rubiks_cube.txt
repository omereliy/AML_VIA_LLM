This is a domain involving a cube composed of six colored faces, each subdivided into nine tiles.  
Each tile can hold one color, and the cube's faces can be rotated independently.  
The goal is to manipulate the cube so that all tiles on each face match in color.  
We need actions to rotate individual faces clockwise or counterclockwise.  
A rotation changes the positions of edge and corner tiles across adjacent faces.  
Only one face can be rotated at a time.  
The cube starts in a mixed state, and the solution requires ordered sequences of rotations.
