This is a domain where shelves in a pharmacy hold various medications, each identified by type and expiration date.  
The goal is to keep shelves organized and ensure no expired items remain in stock.  
Each medication can be moved, disposed of, or restocked.  
Only available space on a shelf can be used to store new items.  
Medications must be checked regularly for expiration.  
A staff member can only handle one medication box at a time.  
Stocking requires retrieving items from the supply room and placing them onto correct shelves.
