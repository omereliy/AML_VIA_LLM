This is a domain where we have blocks and a table.
Blocks can be stacked on top of each other or placed on the table.
The goal is to move blocks from one configuration to another.
We need actions to pick up blocks, put them down, and stack them.
A robot arm can only hold one block at a time.
Only the top block in a stack can be picked up.
The robot arm must be empty to pick up a block.
A block can only be placed on the table or on top of another block.
