This is a domain where two players alternate turns placing marks on a 3x3 grid.  
Each cell may be empty, contain an X, or contain an O.  
The goal is to align three of oneâ€™s marks in a row, column, or diagonal.  
The game starts with an empty grid.  
Players take turns placing their symbol in any empty cell.  
Once a cell is marked, it cannot be changed.  
The game ends when a player wins or the board is full.  
Only one player may act on a given turn.
