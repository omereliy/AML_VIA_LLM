This is a domain where arriving flights must be assigned to available gates in an airport.  
Each flight has an arrival time, size, and required turnaround duration.  
Gates vary in capacity and compatibility with aircraft types.  
The goal is to allocate all incoming flights to valid gates without conflict.  
Actions include assigning a flight to a gate, delaying assignment, or rerouting.  
Only one flight can occupy a gate at a time, and gates must be available during the entire turnaround.  
Assignments must account for constraints such as airline preferences and adjacent gate usage.
